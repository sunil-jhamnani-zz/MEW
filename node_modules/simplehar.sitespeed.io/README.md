# Simple Har
> Har viewer made simple

Modified version of [simpleHar](https://github.com/rafacesar/simplehar/) to be used in sitespeed.io. Love love love to Rafael Cesar who built simplehar!

At the moment this can not be used standalone, it only works in sitespeed.io but lets see if we can fix that!
