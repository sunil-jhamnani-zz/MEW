# async-node-events

An EventEmitter replacement that allows both asynchronous and synchronous emissions and handlers.
This is entirely based off of and almost entirely written by @dfellis in his excellent
[async-cancelable-events](https://github.com/dfellis/async-cancelable-events) module. This is purely
a semantic change with some minor code revision. Even this README is primarily written by @dfellis.

All credit goes to @dfellis.

## Install

```sh
npm install async-node-events
```

## Usage

```js
var EventEmitter = require('async-node-events');
var util = require('util');

function MyEmittingObject() {
    EventEmitter.call(this);
    ...
}

util.inherits(MyEmittingObject, EventEmitter);
```

The API is intented to be a mostly-drop-in replacement for Node.js' EventEmitter object, except with support for node-styled async callbacks.

The primary differences between the EventEmitter and async-node-events are:

1. If the last argument passed into ``this.emit`` is a function, it is assumed to be a callback that accepts accepts the typical (err, result) tuple.
2. The ``.on`` and ``.once`` methods try to "guess" if the provided handler is synchronous or asynchronous (based on its argument length), or can be explicitly registered as synchronous or asynchronous with ``.onSync``, ``.onAsync``, ``.onceSync``, ``.onceAsync``.
3. Passing the maximum number of listeners allowed will fire off a ``maxListenersPassed`` event with the event name and listener count as arguments. The warning the official ``EventEmitter`` prints is simply a listener for ``async-node-events``, and can be disabled by running ``this.removeAllListeners('maxListenersPassed')`` just after the ``EventEmitter.call(this)`` listed above.
4. The various method calls are chainable, so ``foo.on('bar', func1).on('baz', func2)`` is valid.

The primary difference between async-cancelable-events and async-node-events is:
1. The parameters of asynchronous callbacks use the node idiom of `callback(err:Error|Null, result:Any)` rather than `callback(continue:Boolean)`.
